/**
 * @defgroup transliteration Transliteration
 * @{
 * Transliterate from Unicode to US-ASCII
 *
 * Transliteration is the process of translating individual non-US-ASCII
 * characters into ASCII characters, which specifically does not transform
 * non-printable and punctuation characters in any way. This process will always
 * be both inexact and language-dependent. For instance, the character Ö (O with
 * an umlaut) is commonly transliterated as O, but in German text, the
 * convention would be to transliterate it as Oe or OE, depending on the context
 * (beginning of a capitalized word, or in an all-capital letter context).
 *
 * The Drupal default transliteration process transliterates text character by
 * character using a database of generic character transliterations and
 * language-specific overrides. Character context (such as all-capitals
 * vs. initial capital letter only) is not taken into account, and in
 * transliterations of capital letters that result in two or more letters, by
 * convention only the first is capitalized in the Drupal transliteration
 * result. Also, only Unicode characters of 4 bytes or less can be
 * transliterated in the base system; language-specific overrides can be made
 * for longer Unicode characters. So, the process has limitations; however,
 * since the reason for transliteration is typically to create machine names or
 * file names, this should not really be a problem. After transliteration,
 * other transformation or validation may be necessary, such as converting
 * spaces to another character, removing non-printable characters,
 * lower-casing, etc.
 *
 * Here is a code snippet to transliterate some text:
 * @code
 * // Use the current default interface language.
 * $langcode = \Drupal::languageManager()->getCurrentLanguage()->id;
 * // Instantiate the transliteration class.
 * $trans = \Drupal::transliteration();
 * // Use this to transliterate some text.
 * $transformed = $trans->transliterate($string, $langcode);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Drupal Core provides the generic transliteration character tables and
 * overrides for a few common languages; modules can implement
 * HOOK_transliteration_overrides_alter() to provide further language-specific
 * overrides (including providing transliteration for Unicode characters that
 * are longer than 4 bytes). Modules can also completely override the
 * transliteration classes in \Drupal\Core\CoreServiceProvider.
 */

 * transliteration tables are fixed, or for sites that want to use a
 * non-standard transliteration system.
 *
