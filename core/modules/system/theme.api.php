/**
 * @defgroup themeable Default theme implementations
 * @{
 * Functions and templates for the user interface to be implemented by themes.
 *
 * Drupal's presentation layer is a pluggable system known as the theme
 * layer. Each theme can take control over most of Drupal's output, and
 * has complete control over the CSS.
 *
 * The theme layer is utilized by specifying theme implementations in a
 * renderable array. The names of the keys in a renderable array
 * determine how the information in the array is converted to themed output.
 *
 * To invoke a theme implementation on a renderable array, define a key named
 * '#theme' and assign it a string value that is the name of a theme hook. Any
 * variables that the theme hook requires may be supplied as additional keys --
 * prepended with a '#' character -- in the renderable array.
 *
 * @code
 * $item_list = array(
 *   '#theme' => 'item_list',
 *   '#items' => $links,
 *   '#title' => t('Next steps'),
 * );
 *
 * return $item_list;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Do not call _theme() directly; instead, build and return a renderable array.
 * If necessary, the array may be rendered to a string in-place
 * by calling drupal_render().
 *
 * @code
 * $output = drupal_render($item_list);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section sec_theme_hooks Theme Hooks
 * Modules register theme hooks within a HOOK_theme() implementation and provide
 * a default implementation via a function named theme_HOOK(). For instance, to
 * theme a taxonomy term, the theme hook name is 'taxonomy_term'. If theming is
 * handled via a function then the corresponding function name is
 * theme_taxonomy_term(). If theming is handled via a template then the file
 * should be named according to the value of the 'template' key registered with
 * the theme hook (see HOOK_theme() for details). Default templates are
 * implemented with the Twig rendering engine and are named the same as the
 * theme hook, with underscores changed to hyphens, so for the 'taxonomy_term'
 * theme hook, the default template is 'taxonomy-term.html.twig'.
 *
 * @subsection sub_overriding_theme_hooks Overriding Theme Hooks
 * Themes may register new theme hooks within a HOOK_theme()
 * implementation, but it is more common for themes to override default
 * implementations provided by modules than to register entirely new theme
 * hooks. Themes can override a default implementation by implementing a
 * function named THEME_HOOK() (for example, the 'bartik' theme overrides the
 * default implementation of the 'menu_tree' theme hook by implementing a
 * bartik_menu_tree() function), or by adding a template file within its folder
 * structure that follows the template naming structure used by the theme's
 * rendering engine. For example, since the Bartik theme uses the Twig rendering
 * engine, it overrides the default implementation of the 'page' theme hook by
 * containing a 'page.html.twig' file within its folder structure.
 *
 * @subsection sub_preprocess_templates Preprocessing for Template Files
 * If the implementation is a template file, several functions are called before
 * the template file is invoked to modify the $variables array. These make up
 * the "preprocessing" phase, and are executed (if they exist), in the following
 * order (note that in the following list, HOOK indicates the theme hook name,
 * MODULE indicates a module name, THEME indicates a theme name, and ENGINE
 * indicates a theme engine name):
 * - template_preprocess(&$variables, $hook): Creates a default set of variables
 *   for all theme hooks with template implementations.
 * - template_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Should be implemented by the module
 *   that registers the theme hook, to set up default variables.
 * - MODULE_preprocess(&$variables, $hook): HOOK_preprocess() is invoked on all
 *   implementing modules.
 * - MODULE_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): HOOK_preprocess_HOOK() is invoked on
 *   all implementing modules, so that modules that didn't define the theme hook
 *   can alter the variables.
 * - ENGINE_engine_preprocess(&$variables, $hook): Allows the theme engine to
 *   set necessary variables for all theme hooks with template implementations.
 * - ENGINE_engine_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Allows the theme engine to set
 *   necessary variables for the particular theme hook.
 * - THEME_preprocess(&$variables, $hook): Allows the theme to set necessary
 *   variables for all theme hooks with template implementations.
 * - THEME_preprocess_HOOK(&$variables): Allows the theme to set necessary
 *   variables specific to the particular theme hook.
 *
 * @subsection sub_preprocess_theme_funcs Preprocessing for Theme Functions
 * If the theming implementation is a function, only the theme-hook-specific
 * preprocess functions (the ones ending in _HOOK) are called from the list
 * above. This is because theme hooks with function implementations need to be
 * fast, and calling the non-theme-hook-specific preprocess functions for them
 * would incur a noticeable performance penalty.
 *
 * @subsection sub_alternate_suggestions Suggesting Alternate Hooks
 * Alternate hooks can be suggested by implementing the hook-specific
 * HOOK_theme_suggestions_hook_alter() or the generic
 * HOOK_theme_suggestions_alter(). These alter hooks are used to manipulate an
 * array of suggested alternate theme hooks to use, in reverse order of
 * priority. _theme() will use the highest priority implementation that exists.
 * If none exists, _theme() will use the implementation for the theme hook it
 * was called with. These suggestions are similar to and are used for similar
 * reasons as assigning an array of theme hooks to the #theme property of a
 * renderable array. The difference is whether the suggestions are determined
 * when _theme() is called or through altering the suggestions via the
 * suggestion alter hooks.
