/**
 * @defgroup image Image toolkits
 * @{
 * Functions for image file manipulations.
 *
 * Drupal's image toolkits provide an abstraction layer for common image file
 * manipulations like scaling, cropping, and rotating. The abstraction frees
 * module authors from the need to support multiple image libraries, and it
 * allows site administrators to choose the library that's best for them.
 *
 * PHP includes the GD library by default so a GD toolkit is installed with
 * Drupal. Other toolkits like ImageMagick are available from contrib modules.
 * GD works well for small images, but using it with larger files may cause PHP
 * to run out of memory. In contrast the ImageMagick library does not suffer
 * from this problem, but it requires the ISP to have installed additional
 * software.
 *
 * Image toolkits are discovered using the Plugin system using
 * \Drupal\Core\ImageToolkit\ImageToolkitManager. The toolkit must then be
 * enabled using the admin/config/media/image-toolkit form.
 *
 * Only one toolkit may be selected at a time. If a module author wishes to call
 * a specific toolkit they can check that it is installed by calling
 * \Drupal\Core\ImageToolkit\ImageToolkitManager::getAvailableToolkits(), and
 * then calling its functions directly.
